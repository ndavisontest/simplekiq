# Simplekiq

Simplekiq simplifies the boilerplate that sidekiq requires, it ensures that every job is run on a different queue and queues are no longer initialized in the sidekiq.yml

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simplekiq'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simplekiq

## Usage

#### Basics

Use `include Simplekiq::Worker` instead of `Sidekiq::Worker`

You can _only_ pass _one_ hash to the `perform` method. They should be named params, and `symbolized_keys` get's applied to the hash, so write tests and implementation accordingly.

Workers should be _very_ simple. They should find or initaitialize another object and run _one_ method on it.

```ruby
class HardWorker
  include Simplekiq::Worker
  def perform(params)
    TacoMakingHandler.new(params).perform
    OR
    Taco.find(params[:taco_id]).make
  end
end
```

This will do two things:

1. Your worker will default to the `hard` queue or if you are running it in a rails project it will default to the `my_app-hard` queue where `my_app` is your app name.

2. Running `bundle exec sidekiq` will autoload the queue names by introspecting the workers (NOTE: only workers in `app/workers` will be loaded)

Do _not_ declare queues in your sidekiq configuration file, this will throw an error.

#### Alternative to Sidekiq Batches

Simplekiq now contains a lightweight alternative to Sidekiq Batches. Sidekiq batches are atomic and all jobs in a batch are pushed atomically at the end of the block. Sidekiq batches do not scale when the number of jobs are large. Atomicity is undesirable, and we want workers to start processing while other jobs are being enqueued. Example:

```ruby
class TaskEnqueuer
  include Simplekiq::MonitoredEnqueuer
  sidekiq_options polling_frequency: 600, monitor_timeout: 24 * 60 * 60

  def perform
    10.times do |id|
      TaskWorker.perform_async(id: id)
    end
  end

  def on_complete(status:, params:)
    if status.failed > 0
      Slack::Notify('Complete with failures')
    else
      Slack::Notify('Completed successfully')
    end
  end
end

class TaskWorker
  include Simplekiq::MonitoredWorker

  def perform(params)
    # Perform task
  end
end
```

Options:
- polling_frequence: The frequency in which the polling worker runs in seconds
- monitor_timeout: After this duration, the job is not tracked anymore. This also evicts the status for the enqueuer from redis.

Also triggers callbacks when the jobs are complete. The callback receives 2 params:
- status: An instance of the `MonitoredJobStatus` class
- The params for the original job

#### Priority

Instead of declaring the priority for queues in the sidekiq.yml file you can set it directly in a worker, if this is not set the worker will default to priority (1):

```ruby
class ReallyHardWorker
  include Simplekiq::Worker
  sidekiq_options priority: 2
end
```

A higher priority means that queue will be sampled more often and have a higher chance of running the job.

#### Priority Strict

Strict priority is not supported as there is no place to declare a list of workers.

### Testing

Instead of requiring `sidekiq/testing`, require `simplekiq/testing` in your tests. This has all the functionality of the [original sidekiq gem](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Testing), but also adheres to the symbolized params paradigm established by Simplekiq in tests.

#### Datadog

Simplekiq comes with datadog configured out of the gate, including the stats that are already passed using the [sidekiq-datadog](https://github.com/bsm/sidekiq-datadog) gem simplekiq also passes a `service:my_app` tag through the sidekiq middleware.

If you have Sidekiq::Pro then you can set the dogstatsd with DATADOG_HOST and DATADOG_PORT env variables.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
